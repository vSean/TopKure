What is kure?
============

kure is a blogging engine written in PHP. It runs on a flat-file database, which means it stores its posts and other information in straight-up text files
rather than database systems (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.). There are advantages to this and there are disadvantages to it, but we won't get into that here.


What does kure offer?
---------------------

kure sports a templating engine to suit your styling needs and a plugin engine to suit your mechanical ones.

kure is built to be simple, portable, and easy to understand. If you want an engine you can hack into shape yourself, you may become buddy-buddy with kure faster than you think.
Likewise, if you're just learning PHP and want to fool around with something that's not overcomplicated, kure may suit your need.


What's the development of kure look like?
-----------------------------------------

kure is currently in beta. At the current rate, it will probably stay in beta for a very long time. I provide small updates and bugfixes when I can, but I am currently a very busy student.
kure does, however, tickle my fancy, which is why I started it. I love it and I love to develop it. Even more, however, I love people who love kure. Rest assured that I do what I can when
I can, but it won't always be fast.

Please feel free to hit me up if you have any questions, bug reports/fixes, or just want to chat. I'm all ears.
